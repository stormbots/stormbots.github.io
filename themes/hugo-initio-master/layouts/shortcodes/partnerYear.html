{{/*
  This one's funky.
  "intersect" looks at two arrays, and returns items that exist in both arrays
  Eg, this matches partner years [2016,2017] with the target year [2016]
  Because the years are stored as numbers, we need to also
  "cast" the input value from (.Get 0) to a number, and then insert it into an
  array using the slice operator, _then_ we can use it to check for an intersect.
