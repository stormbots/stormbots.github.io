- Robot Name: Blue Thunder

Blue Thunder was our first robot we were able to powdercoat. With Blue Thunder, we were able to intake and shoot fuel with a turreted shooter, as well as gather gears from the human player station to place in the airship. Between our three district qualifying events, we earned the Team Spirit, Excellence in Engineering, Safety, and Industrial Design Awards. At the Clackamas Academy of Industrial Sciences Event, we were captain of an alliance that competed through semi-finals with teams 955 and 5085.

Fun Fact: Blue Thunder was the StormBots' first powdercoated robot.

Fun Fact: Blue Thunder's name became the new team cheer during First Steamworks. <i>"I say <b>Blue</b>, you say <b>Thunder</b></i>!"
