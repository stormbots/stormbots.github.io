- Robot Name: Cora

The StormBots won our first blue banner at the Oregon State University competition during Aerial Assist with teams 1425 and 4457. Our robot that year was known for two T-pex panels (like tie fighter wings) we used to play defense. Since Aerial Assist, we have incorporated T-pex into all of our robots. Cora was also able to shoot the yoga balls over the truss and into the high goal. We earned Team Spirit, Quality, and two Industrial Safety Awards.

Fun Fact: 2014 was the first year the StormBots ever won a competition!
