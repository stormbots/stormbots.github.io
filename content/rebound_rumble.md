The StormBots competed in both the Seattle Olympic and Autodesk Oregon Regionals during Rebound Rumble. At the Oregon Regional, we ranked 44th and were not selected for elimination rounds. We earned our first Entrepreneurship Award at the Seattle Olympic Regional and were able to compete through semi-finals as the 12th-ranked robot.
