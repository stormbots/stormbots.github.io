Logo Motion was the first year we competed in two regional competitions; the Seattle Olympic Regional and the Autodesk Oregon Regional. We ranked 36th at the Seattle Regional and were not selected for elimination rounds. However, at the Oregon Regional we ranked 18th and were selected to compete in elimination rounds with 2517 and 2928.
