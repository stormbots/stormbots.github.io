Ethan Wilmington is a sophomore in the controls subteam. He’s in StormBots thanks to seeing the robot at the club presentation and wanting to join and be a part of it. The hardest part of being on the team is keeping up with homework during build season. If he wasn’t in controls, he’d want to be in programming, though it was a tough choice for him between that and functions. The best part of going to competitions is seeing what ideas other people have come up with, meet other people, and make new experiences. Next year the he thinks the team will be missing the current seniors and have new freshman. He’d love to have a competition because Seattle is cool.

Holly Hutchison is a junior in the Wingnuts subteam. She’s in StormBots because she both likes technology and was inspired by the team going to Worlds in 2018. The hardest part of being on the team is using the new tools she hadn’t used previously in life. If she wasn’t in Wingnuts she’d want to be in controls so she can learn to use wires. She thinks that StormBots has helped her out of school in ways such as in her engineering class where she was way ahead of the rest of the class with coding, because she’d already used it that year in StormBots. Her ideal competition location is the moon for a competition in low gravity. In the further, StormBots will have helped her by familiarizing herself with tools and problem solving.
