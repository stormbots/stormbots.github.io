Ozzie Konez is a sophomore in the controls subteam. He’s in StormBots because it’s a fun way to fill up his freetime. To him, the hardest part of being on the team is the large commitment it is. If he wasn’t in controls, he’d want to be in programming because he feels he’s somewhat qualified to code. He feels that, while the team will change, its not going to change much besides the changing of members. He’d like to go to Guam for a competition because it’s an under appreciated US territory. 

Ben J. is a freshman in the foundations subteam. He’s in StormBots because he wanted to find an activity that would keep his interest, and so far it’s done that. The hardest part of being on the team are the occasions when he as to do multiple things at once. If he wasn’t in foundations, he’d want to be in frameworks because he feels he’d do well there with his prior knowledge of the equipment they use. Next year, he thinks the team will try to get more spaces on the team with it being larger than ever. His ideal competition location would be Wyoming because he, like many other Americans, believes it isn’t real and wants to prove himself right.
