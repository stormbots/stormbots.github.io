# Competition Season Overview

We competed in the Oregon City competition.  We had some problems with our robot in the first few qualification matches, but the team worked together to solve them.  After improving in the next few matches, we were selected to be on an alliance.  Unfortunately, we lost our first semifinal round and were eliminated from the competition.  We finished in 25th place out of 35 teams!  Overall, we are proud of our efforts as a team and plan to do even better in our Wilsonville competition this weekend!
  * We competed at Wilsonville. We went 10 and 2 with our qualification matches, we did so well we chose our own alliance partners. After a dramatic loss and one win, we lost in the quarter finals of the elimination rounds. We finished in second place. Overall, we are proud of our entire team for cheering and we won team spirit. Lastly, we swung light sabers around and danced to awesome music.

  * We competed at Oregon State University, after two days of qualification matches we came out as the 4th ranked  team. When alliance selection came, we were invited by the second ranked team, Error Code Xero 1425, and went on to win the OSU district competition. At the end of the competition, we had obtained 71 qualification points making us the number one team there. That was one of the best days in StormBots history. We won the Industrial Safety Award and the Quality award, overall, OSU was a very successful competition.

  * We had qualified for the PNW Autodesk Regional competition. We were faced with many challenges going up against the top 63 teams. During qualification matches, our robot faced a couple problems making us incapable for the match. At the end of qualification matches we were the 14th ranked team, but were sadly not picked for an alliance. At lunch, the team had their spirits down but with the "Be Like Kelson" campaign we all got our spirits up and are thankful for this learning experience. We hope to do much better next year and make it to St. Louis.
