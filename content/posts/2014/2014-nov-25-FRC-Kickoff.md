# FRC Kickoff - Saturday, January 3, 2015

FRC Kickoff marks the beginning of the design and build season. Teams have the opportunity to meet at "local" Kickoffs to compare notes, get ideas, make friends, find mentoring teams, learn the game, pick up the Kit of Parts, and get geared up for the exciting competition season.

To find more information on the calendar competitions, facts for teams, surrogate kit pickup information, and more, visit [usfirst.com](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc).
