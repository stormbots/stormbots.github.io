What a way to start the year!   Fantastic first competition that sets us up very well for the future.  There were lots of highlights; but to me a day later what comes through so well is how much of a total team effort it was.   From robot performance to team spirit/appearance to parent/friend support to safety performance to consistent Gracious Professionalism – you did it all!

While keeping the great feeling of success, it’s now time for us to think about future competitions.  We have two weeks until Yakima to make improvements and do required maintenance.  The practice schedule will develop over the next couple of days.  Keep up with emails from your subteam mentors.  For now, here is what I know:

* No practices this Monday.

* All team practice Tuesday, 6:00 – 8:30 pm, which will include a required travel meeting for parents whose students are going to Yakima.  This meeting is very important for those traveling – please look for additional informational emails.

* Please note that practice Tuesday will end promptly at 8:30, as we have skipped the weekly mentor meeting a few weeks in a row and the mentors need a meeting this week (Tuesday at 8:30).

* We have NOT yet decided unbag schedule for this upcoming competition; but right now I’m thinking three hours next Saturday afternoon and three hours a week from Monday.

Awesome job, Stormbots.  Enjoy the day!

Thanks,
