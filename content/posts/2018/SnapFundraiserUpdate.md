title: SNAP Fundraiser Update!
season: 2018
---

We have raised $3220 already through our SNAP fundraiser! This is outstanding! Keep up the good work. You may be thinking, "No, we have raised $4600." You are correct, but we actually keep 70% of what we raise. The other 30% goes to SNAP to keep their business running. If you are upset by this, recognize that most fundraisers only allow you to keep 40-50% of the profit. The Payback books cost our program $10 a book a few years ago and we sold them for $20. People may not be buying a product they can keep in this case, but they want to/and are supporting you. This is fantastic.

Now there is this to consider: Currently, 54.3% of the team has received a donation. Once that number hits 70%, we then take home 77% of the of the money raised. If that were the case right now, it would be the difference of $322. While the focus at the meeting was on emails, remember that you can post the link on your Twitter, Facebook, and yes, even Snapchat.

My favorite part: Many of you have come to me and said, "Did you see how much we have raised!?" I love that you have gotten excited about this and can see the progress. Mike Telfair from SNAP is who put our website together and chose the videos and text. Please let me know if you have any ideas of other videos, pictures or text that you think he should add to the SNAP webpage for our team.

Keep up the good work!
