Departure from the school went well this morning. We are on the bus now and ahead of schedule. If you want to follow our team today, here is the best way to do so: https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2018orore  

We hope to be back to school by 9:45-10:00 tonight. However, it may run late. Hopefully, there isn't an accident that closes down the 205 bridge like last year :)

Tomorrow morning we will leave a little later. Please have your child to Skyview by 6:30 so that we can leave at 6:45. I probably won't be able to check my email today, but if you have any questions, feel free to call or text me at 360-921-2747.

Thanks,

>Luke Glassett
