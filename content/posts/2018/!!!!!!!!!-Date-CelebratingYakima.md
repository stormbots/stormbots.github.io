Tonight we want to celebrate the Yakima district competition. I would like to give students and mentors an opportunity to share some of their highlights. This is a heads up in case you have something you would like to share, you will have the opportunity tonight. You do not need to let me know ahead of time, but when you do share, try to keep it under a minute and be positive. Even if you weren't there, you can still share. I've hear a number of stories from people who were here at school watching matches, or at home. <i>Ryan Prudente</i> has a story about watching the finals with his dog that is worth sharing :)

Thank you,

>Mr. Glassett
