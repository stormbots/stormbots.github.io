This week saw the completion of the Build Season and the beginning of the Competition Season!  It is an exciting time, with more to come!  We have a working robot, and will spend this week making it even better before heading to our first competition later this week in Clackamas/Oregon City!  Very nice job, Stormbots!

Below I summarize the week’s agenda, with more details afterwards.  Please read through the entire note.  As always, you may get additional emails from your mentor that take precedent over the general schedule I give below.

First of all, we will discuss a new competition season team on Tuesday, composed of people from the robot sub-teams.  More details to follow, but for now for this competition the following people are part of the new “Robot Team” and need to attend the practices for that team noted below (Darby, Jacob, Quade, Charlotta, Zach, Sage).

### Monday:
6-9 pm practice -- Programming and the Robot Team, plus Caden.  Unbag #2 - Programming.

### Tuesday:

### Wednesday:
