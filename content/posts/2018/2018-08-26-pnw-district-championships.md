We competed at PNW Championships April 4-7 at Portland's Veterans Memorial Coliseum. Although we did not enter alliance selection placed as well as we had hoped, we were a first pick by the #8 alliance captain, 5468 Chaos Theory. Our third robot was 6831, A-O5 Annex. Although we were eliminated in quarterfinals, this was our first time competing in elimination rounds at District Championships. Additionally, we won our first District award, Gracious Professionalism and finished 13th overall in the PNW District.
