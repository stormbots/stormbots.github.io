How are you sharing the values of First?  Here is another opportunity to pay it forward.

>STEM "Boost" club at Harney is scheduled to get underway on Tuesday, March 20 from 3:00-4:00pm after-school.  The club will run for 8 weeks (except for Spring break April 3) and will be a series of work sessions with adult and high school (hopefully) volunteers working with individual students in a classroom setting to assist them in their various projects.
