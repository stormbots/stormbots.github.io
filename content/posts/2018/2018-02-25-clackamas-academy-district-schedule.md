I will be sending out more student specific information after I cover it tomorrow in our all-team meeting, but wanted to send our schedule now since a few people have asked for them. Linked below, you will find:

*	CAIS StormBots Schedule: This one is specific to our team and includes bus departure and arrival times. Please recognize that our bus arrival times at the end of the day are dependent on the schedule of the tournament. If it runs late, which is common on week one, we will arrive later than planned.  

*	CAIS Schedule: This is the general schedule published by FIRST. It shows the breakdown between ceremonies, matches, lunch, and pit times.

Go StormBots!
