What an amazing weekend and performance at the CAIS district event! We finished the qualification rounds with a record of 10-2 and were the third-seeded robot out of 37. We then became the second alliance captain, and along with the help of Apex Robotics (5803) and Beavertronics (5970), we made it all the way to the finals, where we lost to an outstanding alliance. We then earned both the Safety Award and the Quality Award. Each earned us an extra 5 district ranking points, which you can find [here](http://frc-districtrankings.firstinspires.org/2018/PNW)!

The rankings will change at the end of each weekend. The Mount Vernon Tournament is today and tomorrow. Some teams do not play their first match until next weekend.

Thank you to everyone for your hard work, support, and dedication. You made this a fantastic weekend. Our next tournament is in Yakima in two weeks.

Proud to be a StormBot!
