Hello everyone! Weâ€™re going to be trying a weekly blog, where, every week, we let you know what one sub-team did that Tuesday. So, tonight is mostly a test to see if it works well, as may be the next few updates. Anyway, tonight we looked at competitons. 

Competitions were using different graphs to analyze who was doing best at Worlds last season, and what they were doing that went well, through the amount of power cubes that they delivered to the home base and scale.
