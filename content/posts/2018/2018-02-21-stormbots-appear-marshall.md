Hello Stormbots,

 My name is Sara Rodin and I am a 4th grade teacher at Marshall Elementary as well as the coordinator for our Science Night. I was hoping to connect with you about having the Stormbots join us on April 26th from 5-7:30 to either demonstrate or showcase their work. This is a well-attended event and we are hoping to inspire our students in a variety of science areas and thought you would be a great addition! let me know what you think and we can connect on specifics if you have the availability.

Thanks,
>Sara Rodin
