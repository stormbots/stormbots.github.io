title: Spirit Gear From Competitions
seasons: [2018]
---
If you accidentally brought home spirit gear from the Yakima (Sun Dome) or Oregon City (Clackamas Academy) competitions, please remember to bring them back to robotics practice tonight. If you cannot bring it tonight please email me back with what you have so I can have a running inventory of this yearâ€™s spirit gear. Mrs. Snyder worked hard making all those costumes alongside marketing so we would relay appreciate it.

We are missing:
* Bows
* Suspenders
* Tutus
* Ghost Buttons

Blue Thunder,
