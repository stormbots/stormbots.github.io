On Saturday the thirteenth, the "pretty in pink" side of the Stormbot's team paraded to Catlin Gable for the first Pacific Northwest Girl's Generation. Thirteen female robotics teams strutted their stuff with last seasons robots on the Breakaway field. Skyview's girls sported hot pink shirts and comprised the largest group of girls of any team. The girls played an exciting game and even scored three goals in a 2.5 minute round! The didn't come home with the win, but it was a fairytale ending nonetheless.
