# Competition Updates for the 2017 Season

### Pacific Northwest Championships in Cheney, WA, April 6-8, 2017

The team left on Wednesday of Spring Break and drove to Cheney with our awesome bus driver Kelly. We passed inspection and set up our pit Wednesday night, and qualification matches started Thursday afternoon. Blue Thunder put in a valiant effort and ended up ranking as the #34 robot out of 64. Unfortunately, we were not selected for elimination rounds but enjoyed cheering on other teams.

### Lake Oswego High School, March 31-April 1, 2017

We were the #11 ranked robot in Lake Oswego, and earned the G.M. Industrial Design Award.  We were selected by the #3 team 5450 (SHREC) and 6465 (Decipher) but were eliminated in the quarterfinals.

### Clackamas Academy of Industrial Sciences, Oregon City, March 24-25, 2017

We were the #6 robot at the competition in Oregon City. We earned the U.L. Industrial Safety Award and the Excellence in Engineering Award.
