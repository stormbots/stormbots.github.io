# Portland and Seattle regionals Preparations

We decided to build two robots this year for the Seattle and Portland regionals.  That way, when it's time to bag and tag the robot, we can continue working on the twin, looking for other problems to tweak.  We made a shooter mechanism that is unique because it utilizes a rotating wheel to propel the ball ferociously but accurately.  Our team also decided to program our robot to score points in autonomous mode, meaning the robot can score by itself.  The programming side of our team is hard at work getting that part figured out.  Our Robot also has 8 small wheels on the chassis and an omni-directional shooter mechanism on top of the robot.
