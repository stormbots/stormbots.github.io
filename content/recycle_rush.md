Stormageddon was able to manipulate both totes and recycle cans with pool noodles placed by the human player. At the Oregon City District Event we ranked 22nd and were selected by team 956 for elimination rounds. At the Mount Vernon District Event we greatly improved, ranking 14th by the end of qualification matches and were the alliance captain with 4542 and 2928. At our final district event, Philomath, we earned our second Entrepreneurship Award and ranked 6th, selected to be on an alliance with team 2002.
