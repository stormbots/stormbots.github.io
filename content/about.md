<a href="https://www.pltw.org/our-programs/pltw-engineering" target="_blank">Project Lead The Way: Pathway to Engineering</a> high school.  The team meets at Skyview High School 1300 NW 139th St., Vancouver, WA 98685. All are welcome to visit us but please contact

us first about your plans since our schedule varies based on seasonal events. You can reach us by email at info@stormbots.com.



A team needs a lot of different types of talent to design, build, finance, document (video, web, CAD), organize, transport, promote team spirit, market, etc., it's not just about cutting metal

and connecting wires. We have organized ourselves into various departs.
<ul>
  <li>We became a FIRST Robotics Competition team is 2008-2009, our rookie year. We had just 12 students.</li>
  <li>2010, doubled in size to 24 students. Seniors: Kyle, Calvin, Keaton, Brandon, Peter, Eugene,&  Josh</li>
  <li>In 2011, we grew to 34 students, one-third of whom are are girls. We also competed in two regional events for the first time. Seniors: Samantha, Aric, George, Dylan, Cameron, Chad, Cody & Ethan.</li>
  <li>In 2012 we grew to 40+ students and got first place in the Girls Generation competition.  Seniors:  Cody, Tyler, Jeff (President), Ian, Leslie, Hsuan-Ting, Matt, and Jordan.</li>
