<h1 style= "text-align: center"> <font face="Pullman"> Skyview Stormbots: 2811 </h1>

<p style="font-size: 15"> <font face="Helvetica"> FRC Team 2811, the StormBots, is based out of Skyview High School in Vancouver, WA. Skyview also houses the Science, Mathematics, and Technology (SMT) magnet of the Vancouver Public School District, and is a certified Project Lead the Way: Pathway to Engineering school. Feel free to contact us at info@stormbots.com to visit and learn more about our team, but be aware that our schedule varies based on seasonal events. We don’t just cut metal and connect wires, our team needs a wide variety of talent to design, build, wire, program, finance, document, organize, transport, promote team spirit, and advertise. We have organized ourselves into various groups, known as subteams. A complete list of all the subteams and there descriptions can be seen below.

This is a brief history of our team:
<ul>
  <li>We became a FIRST Robotics Competition team is 2008-2009, our rookie year. We had just 12 students.</li>
  <li>In 2010, our team doubled in size to 24 students.</li>
  <li>In 2011, we grew to 34 students. We also competed in two regional championships for the first time.</li>
  <li>In 2012, we grew to 40+ students, and got first place in the Girls Generation competition.</li>
  <li>In 2013, we grew to 45+ students, and created our first climbing robot.</li>
  <li>In 2014, we won our first competition, at the Oregon State competition.</li>
  <li>In 2015, our team size remained around 45 students.</li>
  <li>In 2016, we grew to 50+ students, and won our second competition.</li>
  <li>In 2017, we created our first powdercoated robot.</li>
  <li>In 2018, we won 2 competitions, and qualified for Worlds for the first time.</li>
</ul>

These are the seven main subteams that make up our team:
