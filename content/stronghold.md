- Robot Name: Yertle

The StormBots won our second blue banner at the Philomath competition during FIRST Stronghold with teams 5803 and 2046. Yertle was able to consistently cross all of the defenses and pick up and shoot boulders. This was also the first year the team used belts instead of chains on the robot, and has continued to use them since. We attended three district events, earning the Industrial Safety and Quality Awards twice each.
