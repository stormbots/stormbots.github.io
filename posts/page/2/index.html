<h1 id="competition-season-overview">Competition Season Overview</h1>

<p>We competed in the Oregon City competition.  We had some problems with our robot in the first few qualification matches, but the team worked together to solve them.  After improving in the next few matches, we were selected to be on an alliance.  Unfortunately, we lost our first semifinal round and were eliminated from the competition.  We finished in 25th place out of 35 teams!  Overall, we are proud of our efforts as a team and plan to do even better in our Wilsonville competition this weekend!
  * We competed at Wilsonville. We went 10 and 2 with our qualification matches, we did so well we chose our own alliance partners. After a dramatic loss and one win, we lost in the quarter finals of the elimination rounds. We finished in second place. Overall, we are proud of our entire team for cheering and we won team spirit. Lastly, we swung light sabers around and danced to awesome music.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We competed at Oregon State University, after two days of qualification matches we came out as the 4th ranked  team. When alliance selection came, we were invited by the second ranked team, Error Code Xero 1425, and went on to win the OSU district competition. At the end of the competition, we had obtained 71 qualification points making us the number one team there. That was one of the best days in StormBots history. We won the Industrial Safety Award and the Quality award, overall, OSU was a very successful competition.</p></li>

<li><p>We had qualified for the PNW Autodesk Regional competition. We were faced with many challenges going up against the top 63 teams. During qualification matches, our robot faced a couple problems making us incapable for the match. At the end of qualification matches we were the 14th ranked team, but were sadly not picked for an alliance. At lunch, the team had their spirits down but with the &ldquo;Be Like Kelson&rdquo; campaign we all got our spirits up and are thankful for this learning experience. We hope to do much better next year and make it to St. Louis.</p></li>

<p>Controls</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Right now, we are setting up the motor controls so they are ready to be put on the board. This week, we hope to mount all the electronics on the board. So far, we have put the fans and fan guards on the motor controls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Research and Design</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are finishing up detailing our CAD drawings to give to fabrication.  This week, we hopefully will get the driving system, the claw, and the shooter done.  We have already finished detailing the shooter and the claw has been completely released.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Programming
&gt;Today we are integrating a graphical user interface so the drivers can easily choose their driving style.  This week we want to work on sensors to control the robot to create autonomous function.  Also, we want to create the robot framework to allow us to modularly create a robot code.  As of right now, we have developed our robot&rsquo;s theory of operations, which includes autonomous behavior, teleoperated behavior, and semi-autonomous behavior.</p>

<p>Competitive Intelligence</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Right now we are working on the interface for inventory and making the system better.  We hope to get two new pages of inventory running this week.  We have already created the database model and discussed a new frame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Technical Marketing</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are working on a Powerpoint to show sponsors, a brochure, and getting updates about each subteam.  This week we hope to start planning a sponsor night, have a meeting about our website and potential changes, design a tee shirt, and write thank you letters to sponsors.  We have already finished our updates about Bunnybots and compiled biographies on each team member.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wingnuts</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Right now we have been adding hinges to the flappy cart.  This week we want to add LEDs to the trailer and possibly puddle lights.  We have already added some hinges to the flappy cart to support more weight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Project Management</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are trying to organize the team and increase efficiency.  This week we can hopefully have all the supplies we need and organize the shop.  So far, we have made a lot of progress organizing the shop, tool cabinets, and cubbies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fabrication
&gt; We are working on the chassis of our robot.  We are cooperating closely with research and design to finish up the detailed designs of the robot and start building parts.</p>
