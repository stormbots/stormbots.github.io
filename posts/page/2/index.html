<h1 id="competition-season-overview">Competition Season Overview</h1>

<p>We competed in the Oregon City competition.  We had some problems with our robot in the first few qualification matches, but the team worked together to solve them.  After improving in the next few matches, we were selected to be on an alliance.  Unfortunately, we lost our first semifinal round and were eliminated from the competition.  We finished in 25th place out of 35 teams!  Overall, we are proud of our efforts as a team and plan to do even better in our Wilsonville competition this weekend!
  * We competed at Wilsonville. We went 10 and 2 with our qualification matches, we did so well we chose our own alliance partners. After a dramatic loss and one win, we lost in the quarter finals of the elimination rounds. We finished in second place. Overall, we are proud of our entire team for cheering and we won team spirit. Lastly, we swung light sabers around and danced to awesome music.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We competed at Oregon State University, after two days of qualification matches we came out as the 4th ranked  team. When alliance selection came, we were invited by the second ranked team, Error Code Xero 1425, and went on to win the OSU district competition. At the end of the competition, we had obtained 71 qualification points making us the number one team there. That was one of the best days in StormBots history. We won the Industrial Safety Award and the Quality award, overall, OSU was a very successful competition.</p></li>

<li><p>We had qualified for the PNW Autodesk Regional competition. We were faced with many challenges going up against the top 63 teams. During qualification matches, our robot faced a couple problems making us incapable for the match. At the end of qualification matches we were the 14th ranked team, but were sadly not picked for an alliance. At lunch, the team had their spirits down but with the &ldquo;Be Like Kelson&rdquo; campaign we all got our spirits up and are thankful for this learning experience. We hope to do much better next year and make it to St. Louis.</p></li>

<p>Controls</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Right now, we are setting up the motor controls so they are ready to be put on the board. This week, we hope to mount all the electronics on the board. So far, we have put the fans and fan guards on the motor controls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Research and Design</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are finishing up detailing our CAD drawings to give to fabrication.  This week, we hopefully will get the driving system, the claw, and the shooter done.  We have already finished detailing the shooter and the claw has been completely released.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Programming
&gt;Today we are integrating a graphical user interface so the drivers can easily choose their driving style.  This week we want to work on sensors to control the robot to create autonomous function.  Also, we want to create the robot framework to allow us to modularly create a robot code.  As of right now, we have developed our robot&rsquo;s theory of operations, which includes autonomous behavior, teleoperated behavior, and semi-autonomous behavior.</p>

<p>Competitive Intelligence</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Right now we are working on the interface for inventory and making the system better.  We hope to get two new pages of inventory running this week.  We have already created the database model and discussed a new frame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Technical Marketing</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are working on a Powerpoint to show sponsors, a brochure, and getting updates about each subteam.  This week we hope to start planning a sponsor night, have a meeting about our website and potential changes, design a tee shirt, and write thank you letters to sponsors.  We have already finished our updates about Bunnybots and compiled biographies on each team member.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wingnuts</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Right now we have been adding hinges to the flappy cart.  This week we want to add LEDs to the trailer and possibly puddle lights.  We have already added some hinges to the flappy cart to support more weight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Project Management</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are trying to organize the team and increase efficiency.  This week we can hopefully have all the supplies we need and organize the shop.  So far, we have made a lot of progress organizing the shop, tool cabinets, and cubbies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fabrication
&gt; We are working on the chassis of our robot.  We are cooperating closely with research and design to finish up the detailed designs of the robot and start building parts.</p>

<p><img src="2012StormBot.4.png" alt="2012 Robot" /></p>

<p>Sitting in the cheering crowd, anticipation flows through my body; the FRC Team 2811 Skyview Stormbot 4, affectionately nicknamed the “Linfiltrator 2811” after the basketball player Jeremy Lin, was about to compete. Amongst the rest of the audience at the 2012 Autodesk Oregon Regional, I cry out in excitement and joy. It would be our time to shine: we would show everyone what the outcome of our hard work would be. Our robot sits still before the match starts. Tension fills my body. Autonomous mode is over, and our robot remains still, as planned. The match starts, and our robot is motionless.</p>

<p>Connor, one of the robot drivers, was definitely surprised. The robot didn’t move the entire match, and our rankings would clearly suffer because of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I was scared; during the entire match, I was in great psychological pain.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem with the robot couldn’t be diagnosed at first. Both Aric and Mike felt the same way about our robot’s lack of mobility: frustrated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“All I could think when it happened was: ‘come on, why do you have to stop working now?’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, instead of throwing in the towel and calling it quits, the team went into overdrive to root out the source of the robot’s problem. That called for tons of hustling, analyzing, and intense work. It was later determined that some loose wires and a fired motor controller would be the cause of our robot’s paralysis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Once we figured out what was wrong with the robot, I was relieved. It didn’t defeat us. In a way, it gave us strength.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps the robot malfunction was more useful than having it operating perfectly the entire time. It showed the team exactly what perseverance and determination could do. In spectacular 2811 style, we not only constructed a robot, but we discovered skills for our future. We learned how powerful willpower is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The team worked so hard on fixing up the robot. I’m proud to be a part of this team”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fixing the failing robot was just the start, improving the robot is our next step. Jeff reveals that the newly fixed robot might be getting quite a few upgrades before our next competition in Seattle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“With some reprogramming and rewriting, we’ll eventually get it to do everything we planned it to do, like autonomous mode. The whole team works hard, and we’ll keep on working hard to improve our robot.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="portland-and-seattle-regionals-preparations">Portland and Seattle regionals Preparations</h1>

<p>We decided to build two robots this year for the Seattle and Portland regionals.  That way, when it&rsquo;s time to bag and tag the robot, we can continue working on the twin, looking for other problems to tweak.  We made a shooter mechanism that is unique because it utilizes a rotating wheel to propel the ball ferociously but accurately.  Our team also decided to program our robot to score points in autonomous mode, meaning the robot can score by itself.  The programming side of our team is hard at work getting that part figured out.  Our Robot also has 8 small wheels on the chassis and an omni-directional shooter mechanism on top of the robot.</p>
