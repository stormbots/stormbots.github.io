<h1 id="robotics-story-from-march-10-at-the-2012-autodesk-oregon-regional-competition">Robotics Story from March 10 at the 2012 Autodesk Oregon Regional Competition</h1>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Written by: Jason Vilaysanh</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="2012StormBot.4.png" alt="2012 Robot" /></p>

<p>Sitting in the cheering crowd, anticipation flows through my body; the FRC Team 2811 Skyview Stormbot 4, affectionately nicknamed the “Linfiltrator 2811” after the basketball player Jeremy Lin, was about to compete. Amongst the rest of the audience at the 2012 Autodesk Oregon Regional, I cry out in excitement and joy. It would be our time to shine: we would show everyone what the outcome of our hard work would be. Our robot sits still before the match starts. Tension fills my body. Autonomous mode is over, and our robot remains still, as planned. The match starts, and our robot is motionless.</p>

<p>Connor, one of the robot drivers, was definitely surprised. The robot didn’t move the entire match, and our rankings would clearly suffer because of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I was scared; during the entire match, I was in great psychological pain.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem with the robot couldn’t be diagnosed at first. Both Aric and Mike felt the same way about our robot’s lack of mobility: frustrated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“All I could think when it happened was: ‘come on, why do you have to stop working now?’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, instead of throwing in the towel and calling it quits, the team went into overdrive to root out the source of the robot’s problem. That called for tons of hustling, analyzing, and intense work. It was later determined that some loose wires and a fired motor controller would be the cause of our robot’s paralysis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Once we figured out what was wrong with the robot, I was relieved. It didn’t defeat us. In a way, it gave us strength.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps the robot malfunction was more useful than having it operating perfectly the entire time. It showed the team exactly what perseverance and determination could do. In spectacular 2811 style, we not only constructed a robot, but we discovered skills for our future. We learned how powerful willpower is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The team worked so hard on fixing up the robot. I’m proud to be a part of this team”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fixing the failing robot was just the start, improving the robot is our next step. Jeff reveals that the newly fixed robot might be getting quite a few upgrades before our next competition in Seattle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“With some reprogramming and rewriting, we’ll eventually get it to do everything we planned it to do, like autonomous mode. The whole team works hard, and we’ll keep on working hard to improve our robot.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="portland-and-seattle-regionals-preparations">Portland and Seattle regionals Preparations</h1>

<p>We decided to build two robots this year for the Seattle and Portland regionals.  That way, when it&rsquo;s time to bag and tag the robot, we can continue working on the twin, looking for other problems to tweak.  We made a shooter mechanism that is unique because it utilizes a rotating wheel to propel the ball ferociously but accurately.  Our team also decided to program our robot to score points in autonomous mode, meaning the robot can score by itself.  The programming side of our team is hard at work getting that part figured out.  Our Robot also has 8 small wheels on the chassis and an omni-directional shooter mechanism on top of the robot.</p>

<p>I work for Columbia Ultimate, and I am Senior Software Engineer.  This will be second season I have mentored for robotics. I like robotics because it is all about learning and knowledge sharing.  I mentor for programming, and Competitive Intelligence sub-teams.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Craig Boezwinkle:
&gt;I work for Western Integrated Technologies in Portland.  We primarily build and sell hydraulic, pneumatic, and automation systems and components.  My job is to design those systems, and also to work with our customers
to define the requirements for a project and educate them on the different possible solutions. This is my 4th season mentoring.  I mentor because I really believe in the mission of FIRST.  Our world needs more smart young people
and more engaging activities to help them learn.  I participated in similar programs while I was in high school and college, which enabled me to learn things I never would have been able to get out of a textbook.  FIRST is a
program that aligns well with my experience, interests, and ability to teach, and I appreciate the opportunity to
 give back and help others.  My favorite thing about mentoring is seeing somebody understand something for the
first time.  When a concept that was previously unclear becomes understood, everyone wins.</p>

<p>Dave Hansen:</p>

<p>David Perry:</p>

<p>Inna Zhabko:</p>

<p>Jake Furness:
&gt;I work at Sigma Design as a mechanical design engineer. This is my first year mentoring.  I mentor for robotics because no matter how advanced they get, they still can&rsquo;t kill Sarah Conner.</p>

<p>John Cook:
&gt;I work for The Boeing Company in the Fabrication Division out of Portland Oregon.  I am a Process Engineer,
working on process improvements and quality issues that are systemic.  I am also the site Subject Matter Expert
on shot peening, a process that enhances the fatigue life of critical life limited parts.  This is my 4th season mentoring the Stormbots, team 2811.  My favorite part of robotics, is helping the students understand the real life aspect of engineering and manufacturing.  It is great to see such young minds be so creative and imaginative, however, they must keep in retrospect that what you design, must also be fabricated and assembled on time and within budget.<br />
And of course there is the final product, the robot.  It&rsquo;s rewarding to see the robot, they designed and built in competition, competing at the high level.</p>

<p>Ken Budnik:
&gt;I work for iGrafx LLC., and do Senior Consulting and Development ,Engineer Custom software development,
Customer support, and Field technical sales support.  I have mentored for 3 years (this is the fourth).  There is a
great deal of satisfaction in seeing students rise to the occasion and build a working robot.  Arriving at regionals
and seeing this same feat repeated by hundreds of students is even better!  My college degree is Electrical
Engineering, Control Systems, with a 20+ year career in various software applications.  Why mentor?  I can, so
I do.  (I&rsquo;ve never had a child in the program, though they are both recent grads of Skyview.)</p>

<p>Kim Hansen:</p>

<p><img src="/images/kimhansen.jpg" alt="Kim Hansen" />
&gt;I am a teacher at Skyview High School in Vancouver Public Schools.  I teach Algebra in the SMT Magnet Program
and Video Game Programming. This is my 3rd year mentoring for the StormBots.  My favorite thing about
Robotics is watching students use math, science and engineering with a real-world problem they are solving.  I joined because my son is on the team.  I am still doing it because it&rsquo;s so much fun!</p>

<p>Kyle Watson:
&gt;I joined the team in our inaugural season of 2008, after our Jay Platt, CEO of Platt Electric Supply, one of our team sponsors, and my employer since 1988, encouraged me to check out the FIRST Robotics program.  Jay noted the breadth of the program, not only the Science and Math aspects, but the additional business aspects of the program. Currently I work in sales and applications of control products.  Prior to joining Platt Electric Supply, I have worked in the Instrumentation, Controls, and Electrical
Industries since graduating from the Perry Technical Institute, in 1981.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The greatest aspect of being a mentor of our team, is watching our young people grasp a concept, and taking ownership of the idea, till completion.  Just clarify a students question, support the answer with a practical example, and watch them go!</p>

<p>Control and Electronics Mentor.</p>

<p>Peter Miller:</p>

<p><img src="/images/petermiller.jpg" alt="Peter Miller" />
&gt;I am currently a student at Clark College.  This is my second year mentoring.  My favorite thing about robotics
is being able to watch ideas come to fruition in the robot.  I mentor for robotics because I enjoyed it when I
participated as a student and want other students to have the chance to enjoy it also.</p>

<p>Phil Hays:</p>

<p><img src="/images/philhays.jpg" alt="Phil Hays" />
&gt;I teach pre-engineering and robotics classes at Skyview High School.  I started the FIRST Robotics Competition
team at Skyview four years ago.  I was asked to start the team because I teach pre-engineering classes at
Skyview. I believe that FIRST Robotics is a very powerful complement to those classes and allows students to
explore engineering in real-world applications under conditions similar to what real engineers do.  And, it&rsquo;s very
fun and exciting to watch students design and operate their own creations.</p>

<p>Russ Barber:</p>

<p>Steve Koostra:
&gt;I Used to be the divisional ASIC/Systems architect for HP&rsquo;s Procurve Networking Business (routers and switches) in Roseville, CA.  This is my first year Mentoring for Skyviews FIRST Robotics.  Robotics represents a chance for kids to get practical exposure to design problems and how things really get done in engineering environments.  It broadens people in ways that you seldom see just from school.<br />
I see this as valuable for my own kids and am happy to help provide it for others.</p>

<p>20 teams attended this year&rsquo;s BunnyBot.  Of those 20 teams, our Skyview robotics team took 11th Place in the final standings.  Many of the team members who participated either worked on the robot (build team), asked other teams how they raise money (marketing team), and/or drove the robot (drive team).  Our drivers were Misha, Kelson, Connor, and Thomas.  At BunnyBot each team was pared up with another team.  The stronger teams would get pared up with the weaker teams so that the competitors were evenly matched.  Each team got to compete about 5 times (some teams would play more or less depending on how much problems their robot encountered).  A few teams had two robots.  And Catlin Gabel had three Robotics teams!  Even though we didn&rsquo;t make it to the finals we tried our best and came home a little wiser than we were before.</p>

Thirteen female robotics teams strutted their stuff with last seasons robots on the Breakaway field. Skyview&rsquo;s girls sported hot pink shirts and comprised the largest group of girls of any team. The girls played an exciting game and even scored three goals in a 2.5 minute round! The didn&rsquo;t come home with the win, but it was a fairytale ending nonetheless.</p>

<p>Skyview robotics team girls&ndash;Leslie, Becca, Madeline, Lauren, Zoey, and Hsuan-Ting—took the team’s competition robot from last season to Catlin Gable School on October 29 for the 2nd Annual girls-only “Girls Generation Robotics Competition.” This competition hopes  to inspire girls to take advantage of the opportunities through FIRST Robotics to get “hands-on” experience with technology.  It gives them a slight “leg up” over their often more domineering male counterparts, and a chance to witness the fun of engineering for themselves. Girls generation is a competition in which girls get to go work on the robot and drive it in a competition exactly like last year’s competition but in an all girls environment.
Our team of girls worked hard and captured first place with their alliance partner.  “We improved a lot from last year and especially in communicating skills” said Becca, a Sophomore, second year team member and the team’s Safety Captain. The girls liked fixing and driving the robot, interacting with other teams and helping rookies.  Our girls also learned a lot about the competition, and how easily the robots can break—and how to fix them.  When the girls were asked how big a role they thought that girls play in a robotics team they said that they don’t play a huge role, but they’re becoming more important.
The whole team—40 students this year!&ndash; is gearing up for the winter pre-season event, Bunny Bot (<em>where stuffed animals meet robots</em>), to be held Saturday, December 17 at Catlin Gable School in Portland. Last year the team took second place and is looking for an improved showing with its new design this year.  On January 7, 2012 our official season starts, and we will have six weeks to design and build our robot for the 2012 FIRST world competition.</p>

<p>A solid team effort captures 2nd place at the 2010 BunnyBot competition at Catlin Gable School in Portland. Carrying over the pink theme in shirt design, the team&rsquo;s robust design, flawless programming and outstanding team work enabled them to survive  8 bolt-rattling rounds to make it to the championship finale.</p>

<p>Other robots were knocked over or had large and small pieces of their &lsquo;bots fly off during intense clashes during play. The StormBots amassed 72 points and was selected to by second highest scoring team1823 from Lincoln High/Portland to be their alliance parter in the championship showdown against Team Mean Machine (Camas/Washougal) and The Flaming Chickens from the host school.</p>

						<p>March was the final countdown! The robotics build season amounted up to one peaking moment, the Autodesk Oregon Regional FIRST competition at the Memorial Coliseum. 30 hours of competition over three days were jam packed with spirited teams sporting their colors, mascots dancing to the Macarena, and robots in action battling it out on the field. A total of 104 fierce rounds were played, each consisting of 3 teams on a red alliance and 3 on a blue alliance. Each team had a robot playing a goalie, midfield, and forward positions. Teams also had a chance to score extra points by raising their robot completely off the ground before time ran out. Intense showdowns were fought out on the field, and rivalries as electric as Optimus Prime and Megatron’s ensured that there would never be a dull moment. Sparks flew and a couple of robots even went up in smoke but the Stormbots, with a lightning fast robot and dynamic design ended the qualification rounds in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110208033304/http://www2.usfirst.org/2010comp/events/OR/rankings.html">8th out of 61 teams</a>, automatically moving in to the quarter finals! The Stormbots design even won the General Motors Industrial Design award due to its interesting use of a vacuum system and pneumatics. Even though we didn’t bring home the gold this time, the Storm definitely blew away the competition!</p>
