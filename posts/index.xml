      <description>Competition Season Overview We competed in the Oregon City competition. We had some problems with our robot in the first few qualification matches, but the team worked together to solve them. After improving in the next few matches, we were selected to be on an alliance. Unfortunately, we lost our first semifinal round and were eliminated from the competition. We finished in 25th place out of 35 teams! Overall, we are proud of our efforts as a team and plan to do even better in our Wilsonville competition this weekend!</description>

      <description>Subteam Updates Controls
 Right now, we are setting up the motor controls so they are ready to be put on the board. This week, we hope to mount all the electronics on the board. So far, we have put the fans and fan guards on the motor controls.
 Research and Design
 We are finishing up detailing our CAD drawings to give to fabrication. This week, we hopefully will get the driving system, the claw, and the shooter done.</description>

      <description>Robotics Story from March 10 at the 2012 Autodesk Oregon Regional Competition  Written by: Jason Vilaysanh
 Sitting in the cheering crowd, anticipation flows through my body; the FRC Team 2811 Skyview Stormbot 4, affectionately nicknamed the “Linfiltrator 2811” after the basketball player Jeremy Lin, was about to compete. Amongst the rest of the audience at the 2012 Autodesk Oregon Regional, I cry out in excitement and joy. It would be our time to shine: we would show everyone what the outcome of our hard work would be.</description>

      <description>Portland and Seattle regionals Preparations We decided to build two robots this year for the Seattle and Portland regionals. That way, when it&amp;rsquo;s time to bag and tag the robot, we can continue working on the twin, looking for other problems to tweak. We made a shooter mechanism that is unique because it utilizes a rotating wheel to propel the ball ferociously but accurately. Our team also decided to program our robot to score points in autonomous mode, meaning the robot can score by itself.</description>

Many of the team members who participated either worked on the robot (build team), asked other teams how they raise money (marketing team), and/or drove the robot (drive team). Our drivers were Misha, Kelson, Connor, and Thomas. At BunnyBot each team was pared up with another team.</description>

      <description>StormBots Dominate at Girls Generation 2011 Skyview robotics team girls&amp;ndash;Leslie, Becca, Madeline, Lauren, Zoey, and Hsuan-Ting—took the team’s competition robot from last season to Catlin Gable School on October 29 for the 2nd Annual girls-only “Girls Generation Robotics Competition.” This competition hopes to inspire girls to take advantage of the opportunities through FIRST Robotics to get “hands-on” experience with technology. It gives them a slight “leg up” over their often more domineering male counterparts, and a chance to witness the fun of engineering for themselves.</description>

 A solid team effort captures 2nd place at the 2010 BunnyBot competition at Catlin Gable School in Portland. Carrying over the pink theme in shirt design, the team&amp;rsquo;s robust design, flawless programming and outstanding team work enabled them to survive 8 bolt-rattling rounds to make it to the championship finale.
Other robots were knocked over or had large and small pieces of their &amp;lsquo;bots fly off during intense clashes during play.</description>

A total of 104 fierce rounds were played, each consisting of 3 teams on a red alliance and 3 on a blue alliance.</description>
