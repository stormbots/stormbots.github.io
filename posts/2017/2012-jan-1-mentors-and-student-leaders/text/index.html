<p>Basil Zhabko:</p>

<p><img src="/images/BasilZhabko.png" alt="Basil Zhabko" /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I work for Columbia Ultimate, and I am Senior Software Engineer.  This will be second season I have mentored for robotics. I like robotics because it is all about learning and knowledge sharing.  I mentor for programming, and Competitive Intelligence sub-teams.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Craig Boezwinkle:
&gt;I work for Western Integrated Technologies in Portland.  We primarily build and sell hydraulic, pneumatic, and automation systems and components.  My job is to design those systems, and also to work with our customers
to define the requirements for a project and educate them on the different possible solutions. This is my 4th season mentoring.  I mentor because I really believe in the mission of FIRST.  Our world needs more smart young people
and more engaging activities to help them learn.  I participated in similar programs while I was in high school and college, which enabled me to learn things I never would have been able to get out of a textbook.  FIRST is a
program that aligns well with my experience, interests, and ability to teach, and I appreciate the opportunity to
 give back and help others.  My favorite thing about mentoring is seeing somebody understand something for the
first time.  When a concept that was previously unclear becomes understood, everyone wins.</p>

<p>Dave Hansen:</p>

<p>David Perry:</p>

<p>Inna Zhabko:</p>

<p>Jake Furness:
&gt;I work at Sigma Design as a mechanical design engineer. This is my first year mentoring.  I mentor for robotics because no matter how advanced they get, they still can&rsquo;t kill Sarah Conner.</p>

<p>John Cook:
&gt;I work for The Boeing Company in the Fabrication Division out of Portland Oregon.  I am a Process Engineer,
working on process improvements and quality issues that are systemic.  I am also the site Subject Matter Expert
on shot peening, a process that enhances the fatigue life of critical life limited parts.  This is my 4th season mentoring the Stormbots, team 2811.  My favorite part of robotics, is helping the students understand the real life aspect of engineering and manufacturing.  It is great to see such young minds be so creative and imaginative, however, they must keep in retrospect that what you design, must also be fabricated and assembled on time and within budget.<br />
And of course there is the final product, the robot.  It&rsquo;s rewarding to see the robot, they designed and built in competition, competing at the high level.</p>

<p>Ken Budnik:
&gt;I work for iGrafx LLC., and do Senior Consulting and Development ,Engineer Custom software development,
Customer support, and Field technical sales support.  I have mentored for 3 years (this is the fourth).  There is a
great deal of satisfaction in seeing students rise to the occasion and build a working robot.  Arriving at regionals
and seeing this same feat repeated by hundreds of students is even better!  My college degree is Electrical
Engineering, Control Systems, with a 20+ year career in various software applications.  Why mentor?  I can, so
I do.  (I&rsquo;ve never had a child in the program, though they are both recent grads of Skyview.)</p>

<p>Kim Hansen:</p>

<p><img src="/images/kimhansen.jpg" alt="Kim Hansen" />
&gt;I am a teacher at Skyview High School in Vancouver Public Schools.  I teach Algebra in the SMT Magnet Program
and Video Game Programming. This is my 3rd year mentoring for the StormBots.  My favorite thing about
Robotics is watching students use math, science and engineering with a real-world problem they are solving.  I joined because my son is on the team.  I am still doing it because it&rsquo;s so much fun!</p>

<p>Kyle Watson:
&gt;I joined the team in our inaugural season of 2008, after our Jay Platt, CEO of Platt Electric Supply, one of our team sponsors, and my employer since 1988, encouraged me to check out the FIRST Robotics program.  Jay noted the breadth of the program, not only the Science and Math aspects, but the additional business aspects of the program. Currently I work in sales and applications of control products.  Prior to joining Platt Electric Supply, I have worked in the Instrumentation, Controls, and Electrical
Industries since graduating from the Perry Technical Institute, in 1981.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The greatest aspect of being a mentor of our team, is watching our young people grasp a concept, and taking ownership of the idea, till completion.  Just clarify a students question, support the answer with a practical example, and watch them go!</p>

<p>Kyle Watson,</p>

<p>Control and Electronics Mentor.</p>

<p>Peter Miller:</p>

<p><img src="/images/petermiller.jpg" alt="Peter Miller" />
&gt;I am currently a student at Clark College.  This is my second year mentoring.  My favorite thing about robotics
is being able to watch ideas come to fruition in the robot.  I mentor for robotics because I enjoyed it when I
participated as a student and want other students to have the chance to enjoy it also.</p>

<p>Phil Hays:</p>

<p><img src="/images/philhays.jpg" alt="Phil Hays" />
&gt;I teach pre-engineering and robotics classes at Skyview High School.  I started the FIRST Robotics Competition
team at Skyview four years ago.  I was asked to start the team because I teach pre-engineering classes at
Skyview. I believe that FIRST Robotics is a very powerful complement to those classes and allows students to
explore engineering in real-world applications under conditions similar to what real engineers do.  And, it&rsquo;s very
fun and exciting to watch students design and operate their own creations.</p>

<p>Russ Barber:</p>

<p>Steve Koostra:
&gt;I Used to be the divisional ASIC/Systems architect for HP&rsquo;s Procurve Networking Business (routers and switches) in Roseville, CA.  This is my first year Mentoring for Skyviews FIRST Robotics.  Robotics represents a chance for kids to get practical exposure to design problems and how things really get done in engineering environments.  It broadens people in ways that you seldom see just from school.<br />
I see this as valuable for my own kids and am happy to help provide it for others.</p>

<p>Becca:</p>

<p><img src="/images/becca.jpg" alt="Becca" /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the past two years, I have been on the Wingnuts team and I also have been the safety captain.  I have been
on the robotics team from 2010-2011, and 2011-2012.  I hope to be a Mechanical Engineer. Through FIRST I have learned how to work with others, use the tools in the machine shop, and how time management is very important
if we want to achieve our goal in time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cody:</p>

<p><img src="/images/cody.jpg" alt="Cody" /></p>

<p>Hsuan-Ting:
&gt;This is my first year on robotics team. I am on the Marketing team. I am still exploring different career paths, but
I&rsquo;ll probably going to do something business or marketing related. I am looking forward to apply what I have
learned on business and marketing and the importance of cooperation and management in the future, in college
and the workforce.</p>

<p>Ian:
&gt;I have worked on the Electrical and Design teams. I have been on the robotics team for 4 years since the team
was created. I plan on becoming an Aeronautical Engineer in the United States Air Force. I have learned how to
use shop tools and how the design process works.</p>

<p>Jake:
&gt;I work on the mechanical and design team. I have been on the team for 2 years. I plan on becoming an aerospace engineer. FIRST has broadened my familiarity with the hardware and technology used by industry, and has helped
me exercise my creativity, design, and leadership skills.</p>

<p>Jeff:</p>

<p><img src="/images/jeff.jpg" alt="Jeff" /></p>

<p>Jordan:</p>

<p>Leslie:</p>

<p><img src="/images/leslie.jpg" alt="Leslie" />
&gt;I&rsquo;m on and have been on the StormBots Marketing team for every year I&rsquo;ve been on the team.  I&rsquo;ve been on the robotics team
for 3 years. I&rsquo;m planning on majoring in Biochemistry and eventually doing medical research or going into dentistry.  FIRST has taught me how to work effectively in a team of people, and has given me some awesome leadership experience. I&rsquo;ve learned plenty about marketing, business, engineering, and made amazing connections and friends along the way!</p>

<p>Logan:</p>

<p>Matt:</p>

<p>Mike:
&gt;I have worked on the Electronics and Programming teams.  This would be my 3rd year of being on the Robotics
team. Through FIRST I have learned how to communicate effectively, how to work effectively as a team , and
valuable problem solving skills.</p>

<p>Misha:</p>

<p><img src="/images/misha.jpg" alt="Misha" />
&gt;I have worked on the Labview programming and electronics teams.  This is my second year on the team.  I plan to go into a career in Electrical engineering or another related field.  In robotics I have learned how to work in teams and I have also gained skills in leadership and communication. Additionally, I have learned more about electronics and about how to learn under the leadership of a mentor to gain computer software knowledge.</p>
