  ## The Problem


  We live in a society that idolizes entertainment – athletes, musicians, and
  actors. Yet none of the scientific and technological advancements that have
  bettered our standard of living since the Middle Ages have been due to
  entertainment; they have been due to the hard work of scientists and engineers
  around the world finding innovative solutions to the world’s problems. As the
  world becomes more complex and the old ways of doing things becomes
  insufficient, more and more scientists and engineers will be needed to solve
  the difficult problems of tomorrow. However, not enough young people are
  pursuing careers in science and technology to meet future needs. With the
  introduction of FIRST Robotics, students from elementary through high school
  now have an opportunity to further advance their knowledge on subjects that
  not only interest them, but help them by giving them skills that are
  applicable and desired in today's technology driven industries.


  ## The Solution


  To combat this problem, Dean Kamen, inventor and visionary, founded the
  organization known as FIRST – [**F**or **I**nspiration and **R**ecognition of
  **S**cience and
  **T**echnology](https://www.firstinspires.org/about/vision-and-mission). FIRST
  holds annual regional and national robot competitions for school and
  community-based teams. These competitions celebrate the creative and
  innovative use of science and technology in solving complex problems. Mentored
  by working adults from all career fields, students learn that careers related
  to science and technology can be fun, exciting, and rewarding.

      I loved everything about being a StormBot! I loved working to solve
      problems, coming up with new concepts and turning them into prototypes and
      all the friends I made.

    testimonial: >-
      I did have the advantage of having gained the experience from FIRST that
      most people didn't get until they were out of college. Going into college
      with that head-start was extremely useful.

    testimonial: >-
      In my interview with Intel I discussed how robotics has given me an
      interest in technology. I told the interviewer how proud I was to work in
      STEM and how I would love to continue supporting the STEM industry in my
      career as an accountant. The interviewer even told me that my comments
      about the tech industry made her feel even prouder to work at Intel. I am
      confident that this set me apart from the hundreds of applicants and was a
      significant factor in me getting the position.
