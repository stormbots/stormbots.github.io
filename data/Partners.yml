# This page provides a list of sponsor information
# This can be picked up by other templates and content, 
# to quickly generate shoutouts to our sponsors,
# or automatically generate sponsor pages
# 
# Note: This page is in YAML format. 
# The dash on each new line is the separation   
# between each sponsor. These are all accessed as a list in the templates
# 
# The ">" under notes indicates a folded line.  
# This lets you break up long lines for readability, 
# and will be treated as a single line in templates.
# Note you do need to indent one additional level to 
# make this work
