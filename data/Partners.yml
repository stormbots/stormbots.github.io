# This page provides a list of sponsor information
# This can be picked up by other templates and content,
# to quickly generate shoutouts to our sponsors,
# or automatically generate sponsor pages
#
# Note: This page is in YAML format.
# The dash on each new line is the separation
# between each sponsor. These are all accessed as a list in the templates
#
# The ">" under notes indicates a folded line.
# This lets you break up long lines for readability,
# and will be treated as a single line in templates.
# Note you do need to indent one additional level to
# make this work
