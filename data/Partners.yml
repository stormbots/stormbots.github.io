title: 'Get Involved: Invest in the Future!'
content: "## The Problem\n\nWe live in a society that idolizes entertainment – athletes, musicians, and actors. Yet none of the scientific and technological advancements that have bettered our standard of living since the Middle Ages have been due to entertainment; they have been due to the hard work of scientists and engineers around the world finding innovative solutions to the world’s problems. As the world becomes more complex and the old ways of doing things becomes insufficient, more and more scientists and engineers will be needed to solve the difficult problems of tomorrow. However, not enough young people are pursuing careers in science and technology to meet future needs. With the introduction of FIRST Robotics into the schools, students now have an opportunity to further advance their knowledge on subjects that not only interest them, but help them by giving them skills that are applicable and desired in today's working industries.\n\n## The Solution\n\nTo combat this problem, Dean Kamen, inventor and visionary, founded the organization known as FIRST – **F**or **I**nspiration and **R**ecognition of **S**cience and **T**echnology. FIRST holds annual regional and national robot competitions for middle and high school teams. These competitions celebrate the creative and innovative use of science and technology to solve complex problems. Mentored by professional engineers from the community, students learn that careers in science and technology can be fun, exciting, and rewarding.\r\n\n## **Why me or my company?\r**\n\nSupporting the Skyview StormBots has many direct benefits to your company. Besides supporting youth in the local community, working with the StormBots is a great opportunity to help young people develop interest in careers at your company. Professionals from your company can volunteer/mentor our team and help students build industry desired knowledge and skills in a way that is rewarding to both the students and the mentors.  Financial support provides resources for the students to design and experiment as they code and build functional robotic systems. As a financial or in-kind sponsor, your company name will be promoted on our team's banners at all public team events, on our website, on our tee-shirts, and in our team brochure. \n\n\\[Credit to Team 492 Titan Robotics Club for inspiration on reasons to support robotics teams]"
