  FRC Team 2811, the StormBots, is based out of Skyview High School in
  Vancouver, 

  WA. Skyview also houses the Science, Mathematics, and Technology (SMT) magnet 

  of the Vancouver Public School District, and is a certified Project Lead the 

  Way: Pathway to Engineering school. Feel free to contact us at 

  info@stormbots.com to visit and learn more about our team, but be aware that 

  our schedule varies based on seasonal events. We donâ€™t just cut metal and 

  connect wires, our team needs a wide variety of talent to design, build,
  wire, 

  program, finance, document, organize, transport, promote team spirit, and 

  advertise. We have organized ourselves into various groups, known as
  subteams. 

  A complete list of all the subteams and there descriptions can be seen below.


  This is a brief history of our team:


  * We became a FIRST Robotics Competition team is 2008-2009, our rookie year.
  We 

  had just 12 students.

  * In 2010, our team doubled in size to 24 students.

  * In 2011, we grew to 34 students. We also competed in two regional 

  championships for the first time.

  * In 2012, we grew to 40+ students, and got first place in the Girls
  Generation 

  competition.

  * In 2013, we grew to 45+ students, and created our first climbing robot.

  * In 2014, we won our first competition, at the Oregon State competition.

  * In 2015, our team size remained around 45 students.

  * In 2016, we grew to 50+ students, and won our second competition.

  * In 2017, we created our first powdercoated robot.

  * In 2018, we won 2 competitions, and qualified for Worlds for the first time.


  These are the seven main subteams that make up our team:

      This team is responsible for creating and managing our excellence during
      robotics competitions. The team will help create our robot strategy, game
      strategy, and scouting process. In addition, this team leads, our efforts
      to earn awards at the competitions. This team is a potential fit for a
      wide range of skills.

      This team is responsible for designing AND building the electrical part of
      the robot, including the onboard computer, air systems, motor drivers, and
      wiring all this together. 
    title: Controls
  - description: >-
      This team is responsible for designing and building the various parts of
      the robot that manipulate, shoot, or otherwise make things happen with
      game pieces. This team needs students who want to design using CAD and
      then use machine shop tools to create their designs.

      This team is responsible for designing AND building the base of our robot
      and the wheels and gears that make it go. This team needs students who
      want to design using CAD and then use machine shop tools to create their
      design.

      This team is responsible for creating the programming code that makes the
      robot perform all the required functions. Students will learn and use
      programming skills and scientific analysis to determine the right
      programming for the robot to perform autonomous and driver operated
      tasks.

  - description: >-
      Our most unique team and a true competitive advantage versus all other
      robotics clubs. This team is responsible for leading our safety culture,
      building and mobilization of our competition "pit", and building field
      elements for robot practice.
