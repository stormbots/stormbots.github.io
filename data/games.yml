      This year’s game, “Destination: Deep Space,” involves pitting two
      alliances of three teams against each other, each controlling a robot and
      performing specific tasks on a field to score points. The game begins with
      the players competing to place hatch covers and rubber balls, or “cargo,”
      on rockets and cargo ships before returning to their habitat (hab) 
      platform at the end of the match. The alliance which scores the most
      points wins and earns qualification points to advance to the World
      Championship in Houston starting April 17. <br>
