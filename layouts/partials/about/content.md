FRC Team 2811, the StormBots, is based out of Skyview High School in Vancouver, 
WA. Skyview also houses the Science, Mathematics, and Technology (SMT) magnet

info@stormbots.com to visit and learn more about our team, but be aware that 
our schedule varies based on seasonal events. We donâ€™t just cut metal and 
connect wires, our team needs a wide variety of talent to design, build, wire, 
program, finance, document, organize, transport, promote team spirit, and 
advertise. We have organized ourselves into various groups, known as subteams.
